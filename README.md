Next.js 16 renames `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` — see `src/proxy.ts`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase project credentials
npm run dev
```

### Database

Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` and are plain SQL (no CLI lock-in),
applied in filename order:

1. `..._extensions_and_enums.sql` — extensions and enum types
2. `..._core_schema.sql` — every table (restaurants, branches, menu, orders,
   staff, subscriptions, …)
3. `..._rls_policies.sql` — Row Level Security: restaurant-level isolation
4. `..._seed_reference_data.sql` — subscription plans and menu templates
5. `..._coupon_usage_function.sql` — atomic coupon-redemption counter used by `placeOrder`
6. `..._storage_buckets.sql` — image buckets + storage RLS (per-restaurant folders)
7. `..._mobile_money_payment.sql` — local Mobile Money payment method

Apply them with the Supabase CLI (`supabase db push`) or by running each file
against your project's Postgres connection in order.

#### Verifying migrations and regenerating types

`src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` is generated from the migrations, not
from a live project. After changing a migration, point `DATABASE_URL` at a
throwaway Postgres ≥ 15 server and run:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres
npm run db:verify   # fresh DB, applies every migration, runs supabase/tests/*.test.sql
npm run db:types    # regenerates database.types.ts from that DB
```

`supabase/tests/00_platform_stubs.sql` provides the minimal `auth`/`storage`
objects and API roles a real Supabase project already has — never run it
against a real project. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint,
typecheck and build, plus the two commands above, and fails if the
committed types are stale.

Required env vars (see `.env.example`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — from your
  Supabase project's API settings.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only, used for staff PIN login and
  platform-admin operations (never exposed to the browser).
- `STAFF_SESSION_SECRET` — random secret signing staff PIN-login cookies
  (`openssl rand -base64 32`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — used to build QR code target URLs.

## How auth works

Two separate authentication paths, matching the PRD:

- **Owners/managers** sign in with Supabase Auth (email/password). Every
  dashboard query runs through the user's own Supabase session, and RLS scopes
  rows to the restaurant(s) they belong to.
- **Restaurant staff** (waiter/kitchen/cashier) sign in with a role + 4-digit
  PIN at `/staff` — not a Supabase Auth session. The PIN is verified
  server-side against `staff.pin_hash` (scrypt), and a signed HttpOnly cookie
  (`STAFF_SESSION_SECRET`) carries the session. Staff server actions use the
  Supabase service-role client (bypassing RLS by design) after re-verifying
  that cookie on every request — see `src/lib/staff-session.ts` and
  `src/app/actions/staff-ops.ts`.
- **Customers** never authenticate. The QR menu pages
  (`/menu/[restaurant]/[branch]/[table]`) read public menu data through
  anon-role RLS policies; placing an order or requesting the waiter goes
  through a server action using the service-role client (`src/app/actions/orders.ts`,
  `src/app/actions/waiter-requests.ts`), since anon has no write access to
  those tables by design.

## What's implemented vs. what's next

Covers PRD **Phase 1 (Foundation)** in full, plus working slices of Phases
2–4: real auth, restaurant/branch/table/menu/staff CRUD, QR code generation,
image uploads, menu templates and branding, the full customer ordering loop
(cart → coupon → order → live tracking), waiter-call requests, a functional
kitchen/waiter/cashier flow (including bill creation when a customer requests
the check), and near-real-time updates throughout.

**Customer ordering loop** (`src/lib/cart-types.ts`,
`src/components/menu/cart-provider.tsx`, `src/app/actions/orders.ts`): the
cart is client-side (localStorage, scoped per restaurant+branch+table) purely
for UX — every price is re-fetched from the database by ID and every coupon
re-validated inside `placeOrder` before the order is written, so a tampered
client request can't change what the restaurant gets paid. Placing an order
creates or reuses the table's open `table_sessions` row, sets the table to
`order_pending`, and redirects to a live tracking page.

**Images** (`src/lib/compress-image.ts`, `src/components/ui/image-upload.tsx`):
menu photos and restaurant logo/cover upload to Supabase Storage. Images are
downscaled to 900px and re-encoded to WebP **in the browser before upload** —
a 4 MB phone photo lands at ~150 KB, which keeps a full menu inside Supabase's
1 GB free tier and keeps served bytes small. They're served straight from
Storage rather than through `next/image`, since they're already sized and
optimising them again would burn Vercel transformation quota for no gain.
Storage RLS keys off the first path segment (`<restaurant_id>/…`), so one
restaurant cannot overwrite another's images — verified against a real
Postgres instance, including malformed paths.

**Templates & branding** (`src/lib/templates.ts`, `/dashboard/branding`): 11
seeded templates (3 free, 8 premium) change only presentation — layout,
typography, image shape — never menu data, per PRD §32. The owner's brand
colour is applied by overriding the `--brand` CSS custom property for the menu
subtree, so existing `bg-brand`/`text-brand` utilities follow automatically.
Premium templates are gated: locked on Starter, open during trial (PRD §48
gives trials Business-level features).

**Order lifecycle** is closed end to end: kitchen drives pending → accepted →
preparing → ready, the waiter's "Ready to serve" queue takes ready → served,
and the cashier recording payment completes every open order on the table
session and frees the table. Each transition writes to `order_status_history`.

**Payment** (Congo-first): cash, Mobile Money and card, with manual confirmation in the current release. Automated Mobile Money collection is intentionally provider-agnostic and can be added when a supported local provider/aggregator is connected.

**Near-real-time, not websocket Realtime**: customers and PIN-authenticated
staff never hold a Supabase Auth session, so a browser-side Supabase Realtime
subscription would connect as `anon` — which correctly *can't* read
orders/waiter_requests/bills under RLS (member-only policies). Rather than
weaken that boundary, the kitchen/waiter/cashier pages, the order tracking
page, and the owner dashboard poll via `router.refresh()` on a short interval
(`src/components/auto-refresh.tsx`). The owner dashboard *does* have a real
Supabase Auth session, so upgrading it to genuine `postgres_changes` Realtime
is a natural, low-risk follow-up; doing the same for staff/customers would
first need a real auth/token mechanism for them.

Deliberately not built yet (see PRD §53–56 for the phased roadmap):

- True websocket Realtime (see above — currently short-interval polling)
- Push notifications / sound alerts
- Offer rule builder UI (offers table + RLS + coupon redemption logic exist;
  no create/edit form for the owner)
- Customer feedback form (schema exists; no UI)
- Editing/deleting existing menu items (create works; no edit form yet)
- Online payment gateway (automated Mobile Money collection is not yet connected; there's no
  automatic reconciliation — the cashier confirms receipt manually)
- local invoicing, printer integration
- Inventory, loyalty, CRM, WhatsApp — explicitly out of MVP scope per PRD §54

## Deployment notes

- **QR codes embed `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.** Menu, prices, offers and template
  can all change freely without reprinting — the QR only carries a URL — but
  changing the *domain* invalidates every printed code. Settle the final
  domain before printing table stickers. (A `qr_codes` table with a
  `target_url` column is already in the schema if an indirection layer is
  wanted later.)
- **Vercel's Hobby plan is non-commercial only** per their ToS; a revenue-
  generating deployment needs Pro or self-hosting.
- **Supabase free projects pause after ~7 days of inactivity** — fine for a
  live restaurant, worth knowing during intermittent testing.

## Security notes

- RLS is the real access-control boundary (PRD §51: "Restaurant A must never
  access Restaurant B's data") — verified against a real Postgres instance
  during development, including the owner-bootstrap edge case (a brand-new
  owner has no `restaurant_members` row yet when they create their first
  restaurant) and the negative case (a stranger cannot self-assign ownership
  of someone else's restaurant).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses RLS and is only ever used server-side,
  for the two cases where no Supabase Auth session exists to check against
  RLS in the first place: staff PIN login and platform-admin listing.
