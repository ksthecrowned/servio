-- UPI collection details for in-person payment (PRD section 35's MVP scope:
-- cash / UPI / card with a manually recorded status).
--
-- No payment gateway is involved: Servio builds a standard `upi://pay` deep
-- link from these fields and renders it as a QR. The customer's UPI app pays
-- the restaurant directly, so there is nothing to settle, no per-transaction
-- fee, and no gateway account to onboard. The cashier still confirms receipt
-- manually, exactly like cash.
