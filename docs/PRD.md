## 57. Key Product Differentiator

Servio should not compete as "another QR menu." Instead: QR → Menu → Order → Table → Kitchen → Staff → Payment → Analytics. One system connects the restaurant.

---

## 58. Final Customer Experience

Customer → Scan QR → Branded Menu → Browse → Offers → Customize → Cart → Order → Live Tracking → Payment → Feedback.

---

Owner → Dashboard → Menu, Pricing, Offers, Tables, QR, Staff, Orders, Kitchen, Analytics, Subscription.

---

## 60. Final Staff Experience

Order → Push Notification → Sound → Staff Device / Kitchen Display → Accept → Preparing → Ready → Served. Staff should not be dependent on continuously watching a phone dashboard.

---

## 61. Final Business Model

Servio earns through SaaS subscriptions (₹499 → ₹999 → ₹1,999/month).

Future revenue: premium templates, white-label, custom domains, WhatsApp credits, payment services, hardware alert devices, multi-branch plans, enterprise plans.

---

## 62. Final Product Definition

Servio is a restaurant operating system that starts with a QR code and connects the complete customer-to-kitchen workflow.

Recommended production stack:

> Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase PostgreSQL + Supabase Auth + Supabase Realtime + Supabase Storage + Vercel

**MVP goal**: First make QR → menu → table → order → kitchen → notification → completion completely reliable. Everything else should be layered on top of that core loop.
